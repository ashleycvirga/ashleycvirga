- 👋 Hi, I’m @ashleycvirga
- 👀 I’m interested in growing my skills coding in Python, SQL and JavaScript for Data Analytics and Data Science applications. I have a background in Economics, the wine industry, sales, management and luxury customer experiences.  I'm passionate about connecting the human element with Big Data to help build more efficient, mutually beneficial and compassionate relationships between businesses and their consumers.
- 🌱 I’ve recently completed UC Berkeley's Data Analytics bootcamp program where I gained foundational skills in VBA, Python, Matplotlib, APIs, SQL, ETL, Web Scraping with HTML/CSS, Javascript, R, Statistics, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning Neural Networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects big and small that help discover insights into consumer experiences in any and all industries.
